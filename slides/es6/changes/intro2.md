- you don't have to use it but there's no reason not to
- much cleaner code
- useful code enhancements and methods
- classes make prototypes look much nicer
- native support for modules
- stay up to date (new features every year)
- leading frameworks already use es6: Angular 2, React, Ember.js and much more
- you will love it!
